% Add your HMM MATLAB toolbox path
addpath('path_to_your_HMM_folder');

% Let's say the data is in the form of bid size and ask size variations:
% Column 1: Bid Size Variations
% Column 2: Ask Size Variations

data = load('bid_ask_data.csv');

% Preprocessing: normalize data
data = zscore(data);

% Number of hidden states expected in HMM
numStates = 3;

% Train the HMM with the given data
[TRANS_EST, EMIS_EST] = hmmestimate(data, numStates);

% Now, we need to predict the future state sequence (let's say we want to predict next state sequence)
% We will use hmmviterbi for this purpose

% Generate the state sequence for the data
states = hmmviterbi(data, TRANS_EST, EMIS_EST);

% The next state could decide whether to trade or not
% Suppose state 1 means buy, state 2 means sell, and state 3 means hold

% Last state
lastState = states(end);

% Buy/Sell/Hold decision
if lastState == 1
    disp('Buy');
elseif lastState == 2
    disp('Sell');
else
    disp('Hold');
